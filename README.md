# 🌍 Global Trends in Premature NCD Deaths & Implications for Rwanda

This project explores global patterns of **premature deaths caused by Noncommunicable Diseases (NCDs)**, using Python for analytics and Power BI for interactive visualization. It highlights Rwanda’s situation in the global landscape and provides data-driven recommendations for health strategies.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

- **Goal**: Analyze how premature NCD deaths vary globally and draw insights to inform Rwanda’s health policies.
- **Tools Used**: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, ARIMA), Power BI
- **Data Source**: WHO Global Health Observatory

---

## 🧪 Methodology

### 1. Data Cleaning & Transformation (Python)
- Removed missing & inconsistent entries
- Encoded categorical features
- Scaled and normalized numeric fields

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Descriptive statistics
- Global NCD mortality distribution
- Heatmaps & correlation analysis

### 3. Modeling
- **Clustering**: DBSCAN to identify high-risk countries  
- **Forecasting**: ARIMA model for predicting Rwanda's future NCD death rates

### 4. Dashboard (Power BI)
- Interactive filters (e.g., by region, sex)
- Custom DAX metrics
- Forecast visuals and clustering maps

---

## 📊 Results Highlights

- 🌍 Several regions show alarmingly high age-standardized NCD mortality rates.
- 🇷🇼 Rwanda’s rate has fluctuated but remains relatively lower than many African countries.
- Clustering analysis reveals Rwanda sits near moderate-risk countries, allowing for regional collaboration strategies.
- ARIMA forecasts show a slight future decrease in Rwanda's NCD death rate if trends hold.

## 💡 Recommendations

- Strengthen early screening & prevention programs
- Target high-risk demographics with tailored interventions
- Improve data collection for rural health systems
- Use cluster-based collaboration with neighboring countries

---

## 🔭 Future Work

- Add more granular data (e.g., by district in Rwanda)
- Explore seasonal and socioeconomic correlations
- Integrate mobile health survey data
- Use ensemble modeling for more accurate forecasts
